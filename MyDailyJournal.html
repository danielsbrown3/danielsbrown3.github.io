            I beat myself up a lot today because I feel mismanaged my time. I worked on an ICD document today on a system that was not owned by me and I spent a lot of time learning the system when I didn't have to.
            I think I was expected just to finish the assignment as fast as I could. That made me a little sad because it felt like I wasn't there to produce good work just to finish an assignment. I came home and attempted to work on my scrabble 
            code because its deadline is tonight. Its very easy to just look up the assignment on the web and find the answer, but thats not why I'm paying so much money to be in this program. I'm trying to struggle as much as I can, but my tolerance
            for pain today is super low. It was rainy and dark today. However, I feel hope for the future. Although I am struggling and not finishing things on time. I am recognizing my actions and their influence on my emotional state which I think 
            helps me grow as a person. I also am taking on more responcibility at work at the same time my school work is getting tougher. I am proud of myself for that. I want to do things that are difficult because it makes me feel good to challenge
            myself and believe in myself.
            <h2>Things that made me happy today:</h2>
