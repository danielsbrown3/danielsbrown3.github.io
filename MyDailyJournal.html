            I beat myself up a lot today because I feel mismanaged my time. I worked on an ICD document today on a system that was not owned by me and I spent a lot of time learning the system when I didn't have to.
            I think I was expected just to finish the assignment as fast as I could. That made me a little sad because it felt like I wasn't there to produce good work just to finish an assignment. I came home and attempted to work on my scrabble 
            code because its deadline is tonight. Its very easy to just look up the assignment on the web and find the answer, but thats not why I'm paying so much money to be in this program. I'm trying to struggle as much as I can, but my tolerance
            for pain today is super low. It was rainy and dark today. However, I feel hope for the future. Although I am struggling and not finishing things on time. I am recognizing my actions and their influence on my emotional state which I think 
            helps me grow as a person. I also am taking on more responcibility at work at the same time my school work is getting tougher. I am proud of myself for that. I want to do things that are difficult because it makes me feel good to challenge
            myself and believe in myself.

            Today I had a great morning! The past few days I have not consumed any form of video. Not short, medium, or long form and it has been great. I think I've always known short-form video to give me brain fog but I always convinced myself
            that medium-form video from youtube was ok. But I believe I was wrong. Since I consumed so much of it I was always hearing someone else's voice in my head. Now that I do not, I only here mine which causes he to be able to think more clearly!
            It also feels like I am less drained for the day and the day goes by way quicker. Before I would watch Netflix or youtube passively while I was doing work and it made the day feel super long and the work I was doing unintersting. Now that my 
            brain has no video to distract itself with, the work I have to do becomes more interesting! I have also been thinking a lot about what I am driven by everyday. I think that is currently improving on my ability to think through school/code,
            working on my communication and patience skills at work, and putting effort into my relationship. I recently watched Silver Linings playbook and it reminded me how distracted I can in the tools that allow me to do something that I forget why
            I am doing it in the first place. I wanna use my brain, I wanna be in a relationship with my wonderful girlfriend, and I wanna be a hardworker. All these things bring me happiness. 
            <h2>Things that made me happy today:</h2>
            <li>Had a coffee from a small Japanese bakery</li>
            <li>Worked on python for a good chunk of the day</li>
            <li>Did not watch any video today</li>
