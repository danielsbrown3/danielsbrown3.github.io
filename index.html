  <h3> <em>A Thousand Brains by</em> Jeff Hawkins </h3>
  <p> I'm currently reading <em>A Thousand Brains</em> by Jeff Hawkins about the neuroscience behind the brain and how that informs technology.
    The introduction of the book starts as <span>Jeff Hawkins</span> lays the groundwork of his career. <br> <br> His career is very inspiring, he started as an aspiring
    neuroscientist student who was denied his <strong>PHD</strong> at Berkeley. After being denied he created his own venture into neurology research and shortly after went
    into the computing industry in silicon valley. He founded Palm Computing which produced the first computing tablet. He shortly after continued his journey into 
    neurology by founding the company Numenta.
  <ol>Nuerology is the basis for all endeavors in his career it informs his 
    <li>Computing</li>
    <li>Research</li>
    
  </ol>
