                    <h3>A 3D printed Embouchure-Assistive Device for Musicians with Facial Palsy </h3>
                    <p>I developed a novel 3D-printed embouchure-assistive device designed for saxophone players with facial palsy, which affects the facial muscles and can hinder their ability to play.
                        The device was tested and showed significant improvements in note sustain, air pressure within the mouthpiece, and overall comfort and tone quality. 
                        The design iterations of the prototype are also included as a potential template for broader applications in musicians with facial palsy.</p>

                    <h3>Computational Fluid Dynamics - Determining the Effect of Particle Dispersion of an Infected Individual with COVID-19 in the Classroom Setting</h3>
                    <p>In my study, I used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze how COVID-19 transmission is influenced by various factors within mechanically ventilated buildings at UC San Diego. 
                        Specifically, I investigated how room geometry, temperature, and the location of an infected student affect particle movement and airflow of the virus within Pepper Canyon Hall.</p>
