                    <img src="assets/stats.jpg" alt="Statistics">
                    <p>Analyzed the relationship between total household income and property value in the U.S. using data from the 2023 Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC). My group and I used linear regression models,
                        including logarithmic transformations and an indicator for households receiving social security, to explore this relationship and found a statistically significant but modest association.</p>

                        stock portfolio and low risk index portfolio. Data used was stock price over the last 20 years. Used yfinance API to pull stock data, cleaned the dataframe using python, and visualized trends using Matplotlib.</p>

                      <img src="assets/biomedical.jpg" alt="Intro Image">
                    <p>Developed a novel 3D-printed embouchure-assistive device designed for saxophone players with facial palsy, which affects the facial muscles and can hinder their ability to play.
                        The device was tested and showed significant improvements in note sustain, air pressure within the mouthpiece, and overall comfort and tone quality. 
                        The design iterations of the prototype are also included as a potential template for broader applications in musicians with facial palsy.</p>

                    <p>Leveraged Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to analyze how COVID-19 transmission is influenced by various factors within mechanically ventilated buildings at UC San Diego. 
                        Specifically, I investigated how room geometry, temperature, and the location of an infected student affect particle movement and airflow of the virus within Pepper Canyon Hall.</p>
