# Getting Started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for blogs, documentation, and personal websites. When combined with GitHub Pages, it provides a seamless way to host your site for free.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages for website development:

- **Simplicity**: No database required
- **Speed**: Static sites load quickly
- **Version Control**: Built-in Git integration
- **Flexibility**: Extensive plugin ecosystem
- **Free Hosting**: Seamless GitHub Pages integration

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

1. Ruby (version 3.0 or higher)
2. RubyGems
3. Git
4. A GitHub account

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Install Jekyll and Bundler
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-awesome-site

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-awesome-site

# Start the development server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Project Structure

A typical Jekyll site has the following structure:

```
.
├── _config.yml
├── _includes/
├── _layouts/
├── _posts/
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── images/
└── index.html
```

## Customizing Your Site

### Configuration

The `_config.yml` file is the heart of your Jekyll site. Here's a basic configuration:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Site
description: A blog about technology and life
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site

# Collections
collections:
  posts:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/

# Defaults
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
    values:
      layout: "default"
```

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

To deploy your site to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your Jekyll site to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings
4. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Advanced Features

### Liquid Templates

Jekyll uses Liquid templating for dynamic content:

```liquid
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

## Conclusion

Jekyll and GitHub Pages provide a powerful, free platform for hosting your website. The combination of static site generation and version control makes it an excellent choice for developers and content creators alike.

Remember to:
1. Keep your Ruby and Jekyll versions up to date
2. Use meaningful commit messages
