# Are Personal Websites Useful?

In today's digital age, having a personal website might seem redundant with the prevalence of social media platforms and professional networking sites. However, there are several compelling reasons why maintaining a personal website remains valuable.

## Control Over Your Online Presence

Unlike social media platforms, a personal website gives you complete control over:

- Content presentation
- Design and branding
- Data ownership
- URL permanence

## Professional Development

A personal website can serve multiple professional purposes:

1. Portfolio showcase
2. Blog platform
3. Project documentation
4. Professional networking

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a dark mode toggle in JavaScript:

```javascript
const toggleTheme = () => {
    const body = document.body;
    const currentTheme = body.getAttribute('data-theme');
    const newTheme = currentTheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark';
    body.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
};
```

## Conclusion

Personal websites continue to be valuable tools for:

- Professional development
- Creative expression
- Technical learning
- Building an online presence

> "Your personal website is your digital home on the internet."

The key is to make it reflect your personality while serving your professional goals.
